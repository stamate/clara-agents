# CLARA Agents - Security Research Prototype

This repository represents the initial implementation of CLARA agents, built upon advanced natural language processing technologies. The development leverages the AutoGen framework, providing a robust platform for testing and validating the core concepts outlined in CLARA's technical architecture.

Our first prototype demonstrates CLARA agents' capabilities in analyzing and responding to security challenges in real-time. A notable example shows endpoint security solution detection and analysis using production environment data feeds.

The system architecture follows CLARA's established design principles:

The modular architecture enables seamless integration and customization of agents based on specific organizational requirements. Each agent operates independently while maintaining secure communication channels through the CLARA Core infrastructure, ensuring both flexibility and security in dynamic environments.

Process automation reduces the operational load on security teams by handling repetitive tasks through intelligent delegation between agents. This core feature of CLARA transforms traditional security operations by enabling teams to focus on strategic analysis and critical decision-making.

The initial agent suite includes pre-configured functionality available immediately after deployment, establishing a foundation for advanced capability development. This approach allows organizations to quickly implement basic security controls while developing more sophisticated defensive measures.

To initiate prototype deployment, follow these steps:

Install required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure connection parameters:

```
cp .env_template .env
```

Then populate the .env file with necessary LLM service connection details.

For initial testing, execute a basic scenario:

```
python run_agents.py HELLO_CLARA
```

New scenario development takes place in actions/agent_actions.py, where you can define specific CLARA agent behaviors. This flexibility enables rapid adaptation to emerging security requirements through well-defined agent interaction patterns.

We acknowledge this implementation represents an initial version, subject to continuous development and enhancement. User feedback and practical deployment experience will guide the platform's future evolution through our structured improvement process.

This prototype's development showcases the potential of integrating advanced artificial intelligence with practical cybersecurity applications, demonstrating CLARA's innovative approach to modern security challenges.

System Requirements:

- Python 3.9+
- GPU support recommended for optimal agent performance
- Minimum 16GB RAM for full agent suite deployment
- Secure network access for LLM service communication

Security Notice: Agent deployment should occur in controlled environments initially, as language model outputs require proper validation and security controls.

This version expands upon auto-agent frameworks while implementing CLARA's unique security-focused architecture and proprietary improvements in agent coordination and threat analysis.
